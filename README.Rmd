## Overview

The iNZightTS package provides some simple analysis tools for exploring time series data, which is used by [iNZight](https://github.com/iNZightVIT/iNZight). The package uses [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org/) to store and process time series data and [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) to produce customisable graphics.

## Installation

The _stable_ version can be installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iNZightTS/index.html):

```{r cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("iNZightTS")
```

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/iNZightVIT/iNZightTS):

```{r github, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("iNZightVIT/iNZightTS")
```

## Usage

```{r pkgs}
library(iNZightTS)
```

### Getting started

Use the `inzightts` function to create a temporal data set to be used by the functions of the package. The data is stored as a [tsibble](https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble).

```{r data}
data <- visitorsQ |>
    tidyr::pivot_longer(!Date, names_to = "Country", values_to = "Visitors") |>
    inzightts(key = "Country")
data
```

### Graphics

Exploratory analysis of time series data starts from a smoothed line plot.

```{r raw-plot}
plot(data)
```

### Decompositions

Time series data often exhibit features such as trend, season and cycle. A decomposition plot breaks the data into visual components which simplies the analysis.

```{r decomp}
dcmp <- data |>
    dplyr::filter(Country == "Australia") |>
    inzightts() |>
    decomp()
dcmp
```

```{r decomp-plot}
plot(dcmp, title = "Visitors to Australia")
```

### Visualising seasonal effects

Plots are helpful in revealing the underlying seasonal pattern of time series data.

```{r season-plot}
seasonplot(data)
```

```{r subseries-plot}
subseries(data)
```

### Forecasting

```{r forecast}
pred <- predict(data)
summary(pred)
```

```{r forecast-plot}
plot(pred)
```
